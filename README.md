This repository contains a simple example of a RecursionError in Python caused by improper handling of the base case in a recursive function. The `bug.py` file demonstrates the flawed factorial function that causes the error when called with a negative number.  The `bugSolution.py` demonstrates how to fix the error by adding proper base case handling.
